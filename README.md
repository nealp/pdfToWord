This program takes a PDF file and converts it to Word format. Utilizing streamlit I created this program and turned it into a web app that anyone can use by cloning this repo by following these instructions:

1. Download all the required packages for this program using requirements.txt

2. run the following commandin the terminal: streamlit run app.py

3. The application should open right in your browser

in the directory's terminal. A lot of file converters online are slow, have ads, or may even cost money. This program is quick and free to use for everyone. 

Packages utilized: streamlit, PyPDF2, docx, io
