This program takes a PDF file and converts it to Word format. Utilizing streamlit I created this program and turned it into a deployable web app that anyone can use with the link (link here)

A lot of file converters online are slow, have ads, or may even cost money. This program is quick and free to use for everyone. 

Packages utilized: streamlit, PyPDF2, docx, io
