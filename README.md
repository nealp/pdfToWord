This program takes a PDF file and converts it to Word format. Utilizing streamlit I created this program and turned it into a web app that anyone can use by cloning this repo and copypasting -->

streamlit run app.py

in the directory's terminal. A lot of file converters online are slow, have ads, or may even cost money. This program is quick and free to use for everyone. 

Packages utilized: streamlit, PyPDF2, docx, io
